The ``base_geometry`` module
======================

Using ``BaseGeometry``


Import this ratbag first:
    >>> BaseGeo = __import__('7-base_geometry').BaseGeometry


Check that area is failing properly:
     >>> fail_me = BaseGeo()
     >>> fail_me.area()
     Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
     Exception: area() is not implemented


Check that type is not object:
    >>> type(fail_me) is object
    False


Check that type is exactly from BaseGeo:
    >>> type(fail_me) is BaseGeo
    True


Check for accurate isinstance:
    >>> isinstance(fail_me, BaseGeo)
    True
    >>> isinstance(fail_me, object)
    True
    >>> isinstance(fail_me, int)
    False
